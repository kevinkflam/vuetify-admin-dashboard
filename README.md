Entry for UBC 2030 Sustain Competition

This is a website I built to demonstrate my take on articles from the Ubyssey. I write about the future environmental and food changes, as well as the increase in societal self-responsibility and improving economic growth while developing and maintaining a thriving UBC community. 10 years may seem far away to some people, but I believe that the call to action for a sustainable future is today, so we cannot dilly-dally any longer and must act on changes as soon as possible. If everyone works together by thinking in a more sustainable manner, there will be much less waste, and the planet will be able to recover from all the damage it has taken from all these years of neglect.
