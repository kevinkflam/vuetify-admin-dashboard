        Did you notice those newly installed solar panels on top of the AMS
        Nest? Those are the new solar panels, delivering up to a whopping 1360
        watts per square metre! These new solar panels will be used as a dry-run
        for UBC to see if the solar panels can deliver energy efficiently, so
        the 123 new panels will be used to run the whole Nest, as well as the
        nearby Robert H. Lee alumni centre. In addition, the excess energy
        (hopefully!) will be delivered to the West Parkade parking lot to charge
        the electric vehicles. Speaking of, UBC has had to install 50 more
        electric vehicle charging stations, due to the high rise of EVs in the
        city! And to thnk just 10 years ago when we saw the new Cybertruck and
        laughed, but now you might even see a couple on each floor!
